- __User Goals__

  - Expense Tracking: Users want to easily and accurately track their daily expenses, including purchases, bills, and other financial transactions. They aim to gain a clear understanding of where their money is going.

## Design

- __Design Choices__

As this program was built for the terminal, there wasn't much in terms of design or colour but I did use ANSI escape codes to add a bit of colour where I felt was needed within the terminal to make certain parts stand out to the user.


- __Flowchart__
